Demo Agenda

a) Introduction

b) Data, Data Availability, Data Storages, Data Formats [because we work on Data extensively in the analysis]

Data: Anything you store

Data availability: 3 ways [structured, semi structured, unstructured]

Data Storages: a) On-Premise [in your company level / in your system level storage]
	       b) Cloud storage [third party organizations storage] 
		Ex: AWS, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, WorkDay etc.

Data Formats: 
	a) File stream format [ data in the form of files]
	b) Database format [data in the form of tables]


  
c) BI, BI Process, MSBI, MSBI Exclusive usage.

BI Applications use the above data [ OLTP data {structured} or Generic Data {semi / unst}] and produce Decision support
data [ analytical data]

Any type of data ----> Report / Dashboard

OLTP:  Online transaction processing

	Day-Day business storage processing
	Front-end and one back-end (Web / Mobile / Desktop / Tab front end--> Database storage)
	Ex: Irctc, Bookmyshowm, cash deposit / withdraw etc.


BI: Business Intelligence / Intelligence to the busiess, which helps to take decisions in the part of organizational growth.
BI is a process which takes data, move in multiple layers and produce decision support data in the form of report /dashboard.

BI tools:

	To implement the above, there are many tools available.

	Legacy BI [1990 onwards]

		3 major layers [ETL, Semantic, Reporting]
		Less data, less reports, less customers etc...

		OLTP support [no support to unstructured and cloud ]


	Modern BI [2010 onwards]


		5 major layers [Quality,ETL, Metadata, Semantic, Reporting]
		More data, More reports, More customers etc...

		Any type of data, any store, any format

Note: MSBI released as Legacy BI tool, but also provide support for Modern BI operations.

MSBI: Microsoft Business Intelligence [ SQL Server Business Intelligence]

Introduced in : 2005 [little late then other BI tools]

MSBI as a suite / stack / pack with three major tools

a) SSIS: Integration Services

   Usage: It is integration of three services ( a) ETL b) Windows admin c) SQL Server Admin )

   Core Service : ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
	
   Real-time usage:

	1. To create a huge DWH with lots of volumes. [Extract, Historical Features applying, Load]
	2. To integrate data between multiple systems [oracle-->teradata, teradata-->sql server etc.]

b) SSAS: Analysis Services

    Usage: It is combination of multiple analytical service components

	a) Multi-dimensional service [cube]: More data, more aggregate, more support
	b) Tabular Service[Cube]: Less data, less aggregates, less support
	c) Power Pivot
	d) Data Mining

    Real-time usage:

	To create a seperate storage with aggregate and analytical data for data browsing and reporting

c) SSRS: Reporting Services

    Usage:  It is the combination of multiple reporting components

 	Reporting Services
	Report Builder
	Power View

    Real-time usage: Generate reports and dashboards  from DWH / Cubes [from most of the applications]
		

MSBI : 2008 released

MSBI 2008 R2 

	MDS : Master Data Services

What is the process import export wizard doing in Real-time?

It is creating a package and performing the operations.

=============================================================================
SSIS

Follow PDF 1 onwards sequentially all the topics. The below is just overview of few concepts
=============================================================================

SSIS Definition: 

SSIS is the integration of 3 services and the major service is ETL Service.
[ETL/ELT, Windows Admin and SQL Server Admin Services]

SSIS Real time usage: 

a)	To integrate data between multiple systems
b)	To process data in multiple stages (layers)
c)	To construct a proper Data warehouse and Data Mart.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SSIS Package Execution:

SSIS Start--> Prevalidate--> Validate->Post Validate--> Pre Execute -->Execution--> Post Execution -->Finish

Data Flow Process:

Source--> SSIS Memory(where you installed) / In-line memory or buffer memory--> Target

Source--> SSIS Memory(where you installed) / In-line memory or buffer memory-->in-memory-->in-memory-> Target
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is SSIS?

SQL Server Integration Services. It is the combination of 3 services [ ETL, Windows Admin, SQL Server Admin]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which Service SSIS does most?

ETL Service
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the heart of SSIS tool?

ETL process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the practical flow of SSIS?

Solution-->Projects-->Packages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many components a package contain?

Control Flow, Data Flow, Event Handling, Parameters, Package Explorer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which is heart of SSIS?

Data Flow
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is brain of SSIS with respect to tasks?

Control Flow

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you define Solution in single line?

It is a over all process of operations with collection of projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you define Project in single line?

Subset of solution with a specific functionality and contains packages and other relevant items

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you define Package in single line?

It is the core component which perform three services [ ETL, Windows Admin and SQL Server Admin]
It is a component with collection of containers and tasks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the extensions of various components in SSIS package?

Solution: .sln
Project: .dtproj
Package: .dtsx
Package Part: .dtsxp
Connection Manager: .conmgr
Parameters: .param

Note: Other extensions supported in the Miscellaneous section
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many ways we execute package:

Many ways [more than 8 ways]

a) Debug Menu-->Start Debugging
b) Press 'F5'
c) Package-->right click-->execute package
etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many colors SSIS use?

a) Grey: Disable
b) White: Ready to execute
c) Green: Success
d) Red: Failure
e) Yellow: Running
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the advantage of annotation?

Annotation [with colors and font] will help the developers and others work with the application easily.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the advantage of proper naming convention?

For packages, tasks, containers, and variables names help to identify them easily and also work with them easily.

Prefix Recommendation:
pkg_
df_
esql_

Note: Prefer lowercase for the names.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between variable and parameter?

Variable:
	Stores value and substitute value wherever used
	No user interaction to the variable
	Scope is at Package / Container / Task level

Parameter:
	Stores value and substitute value wherever used
	User interaction to the variable available
	Scope is at Package / Project level

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the major tasks we use in real-time?

Very frequent tasks : Data Flow, Execute SQL, File System Task
Container: ALL Containers
Other Tasks: Execute Process, Send Mail, Expression, Analysis Services Processing task etc.

=========================================================================================
What are the different types of files supported in SSIS?
Different Types of files we use in SSIS?
=========================================================================================

a) Flat File [Fixed width  / Variable [Delimited] ]

	Type: User Defined
	Extension: .txt, .csv,.out, .dat, .vinaytech etc.

	Fixed Width: 

		Here the fields length is same.
		It may or may not have seperators / delimiters.
		Ex: PANNO, AADHARNO etc.

	Varaible Length:

		Here the field lengths are different.
		It will contain delimiters / seperators.
		Ex: Address, Remarks etc..

Note: Delimiters [ Comma, Pipe (|), Tab, Space, CR, CRLF etc.]
	
	CRLF: Carriage Return Line Feed / Forward
	CR: First Character Of A Line
	LF: New Line
	CRLF : First Character In the New Line


b) Excel File

	Structure Type: System Defined
	Extension: .xls, .xlsx etc.

c) XML File

	Structure Type: User Defined
	Extension: .xml

	Note: We need XML Schema Definition File [.xsd file which describe XML content] to work with XML files

d) RAW File

	Structure Type: User Defined
	Extension: .dat

	Note: It is flat file with biranry formatted content [Non readable]

Note: JSON [Java Structured Object Notation] also supported but handling is different

=========================================================================================
Before you work with any file, try to know the below settings
=========================================================================================

a)File location / path : Server name / folder name/ file name / extension
b)File header info {skip info}  :  Ex :2
c)Column headings position:  Ex: 3
d)File type (delimited / fixed length)
e)Delimiter
	Row delimiter:  Ex: CRLF
	Column delimiter:  Ex: ,
f)Text qualifier : How do you want to qualify text
Name and location double quotes, so text qualifier for them is double quote.
g)Locale and code page
Language and country code
Note: Universal acceptable is UNICODE [UCS types]


What is Csv file and how do we work it?

Csv file:  
	a) It is comma separated column delimiter file and saved with .csv.
	b)Opened with either excel / flat file editors {notepad/ word pad}

What is UCS or Unicode? What is the usage of it?

UCS stands for Universal Character Set.
You want to manage maximum possible types of data, UCS is required.

What do you mean by text qualifier?

How do you want to qualify the text, the character used to identify the data.
Ex: “vinay”,  here text qualifier “ (double quote)

=========================================================================================
Types of Data Loading and Tasks Used
=========================================================================================

Real Time Process Flow:  

	OLTP-->ODS/ Stage--> EDW-->DW--> Cubes-->Reporting

Direct Loading: 
		No logic and loading between Source to Target

		Ex: OLTP-->ODS / Stage

		SSIS Tasks: 
			Import Export Wizard, Data Flow Task, Bulk Insert Task, Execute SQL Task

Incremental Loading:

		Already target having data, from source we accumulate that.
		Ex:
		Stage-->EDW
		EDW-->DW

		SSIS Tasks: 
			Data Flow Task, Execute SQL Task


=========================================================================================
Bulk Insert Task
=========================================================================================
More volumes of flat file data loading into target without any intermediate logics.

It calls database bcp [Bulk Copy Program / BULK INSERT DML Command] command process.

Note:
BULK INSERT [dbo].[PARTY_SRC] FROM 'C:\LAB_BACKUP & study material\INPUT_FILES\PARTY_SRC.csv' WITH(CHECK_CONSTRAINTS,CODEPAGE='RAW',DATAFILETYPE='char',FIELDTERMINATOR=',',ROWTERMINATOR='\n',FIRSTROW=3)


I want to load 300 to 700 records in a file using Bulk Insert Task?
Go to options
	First row: 300
	Last row: 700


What are the best options we need to take while loading more volumes of data?

	Options: 
		Uncheck  CHECK CONSTRINTS: So that data loaded faster
		Check      TABLE LOCK: So that other people can not work on the table
		Uncheck   Fire Triggers: So that data loaded faster
=========================================================================================
Data Flow Task

Case Study 1: Normal Load

Take Flat File Source and OLEDB Destination (Table / View), Configure and run. View the result

Case Study 2: Fast Load [ close to Bulk Insert task / Command]

 OLEDB Destination (Table / View Fast Load), and mention fast load options and run. View the result

Case Study 3: Truncate and Load / Fresh Data Load 

	Take Execute SQL Task (Truncate Table Party_Src)--->Precedence Constraint (Success) / Simply Link-->Data Flow Task 

	Run and view the result.

Case Study 4:

	Take Break point at Execute SQL Task, right click-->break points-->Choose radio button On-Post Execute

	Run and view the result. It stops after successful execution of Execute SQL Task, To continue running, Debug Menu--> Continue

=========================================================================================
Which tasks we use frequently in realtime for data loading in SSIS?

Majorly three tasks to process data.

a) Import Export Wizard: Hetetogenous systems load [ slow loading ]

b) Data Flow Task:  Slow and Faster loading [Fastload] between heterogenous systems with / without transforms

c) Bulk Insert Task : Only from file [more data] to table without any transforms 
=========================================================================================

What are the frequently used source and target systems?

a) Flat files (.csv, .txt, .dat, .out etc.)
b) Databases (SQL Server, Oracle, Teradata etc.)
c) Excel Files

========================================================================================
Import Export WIzard
========================================================================================
This wizard helps to load / unload data from heterogenous sources[different].
Ex:
Oracle-->SQL Server
Teradata--> Oracle
Excel-->File [text editor file with any extension  .txt, .dat, .out, .vinaytech...]
File-->Excel

Real-Time usages:

a)* You have some tables in one database and you want to move to other database, then this greately helps.
b) You want to move directly data, then also helpful for us.

How many ways we will open this wizard?

a) Start-->Programs--> SQL Server 2012/2017/2019  -->Import Export Wizard
b) SSMS-->Database Engine-->Any Database-->Right Click--> Tasks-->Import or Export
c) SSDT--> SSIS-->Packages-->Right click-->Import Export Wizard

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice the below two examples:

a) Transfer set of tables from one database to another database in SQL Serevr.

b) Move Flatfile data into Target table

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:

I have 10 tables in Oracle, I want to load all at a time into SQL Server ( need tables created and data loaded).
How do you do that?

Import Export Wizard is the simplest solution.

In SSIS, it requires multiple Data flow tasks

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How the import export wizard works?

It creates an SSIS package with Dataflow and other tasks, process it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: You have more volumes of data in a file and want to load to a table (existed)

There are two ways
a)	Bulk Insert Task
b)	Data Flow Task (Oledb Destination: Use fast load option)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: You need to move set of tables from one database to another.
                 Set of worksheets in an Excel load to tables.

Import Export Wizard
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: You have normal or more volumes of data, want to perform some intermediate 
                 Operations.

Data Flow Task
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you define a source and how many sources are there in SSIS?

Source is nothing but a data feed / data input / data provider / data producer.

In SSIS, we have 8 sources.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you define a target and how many targets are there in SSIS?

Target is nothing but a data consumer / data output / destination.

In SSIS, we have 13 destinatons.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many destinations available to load to SQL Server table?

Many destinations

a) OLEDB Destination  [recommended]
b) ADO.net Destination [recommended]
c) SQL Server Destination [recommended for faster loading]
d) SQL Server Compact Destination [recently added]
e) Recordset Destination
etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement the below direct load examples from the material [PDF1]

a) Flat file to flat file

b) Excel to Excel load

	Note: You will find two general issues while working on it

		a) Version not suitable for SSDT visual studio version

	
		b) Bit not suitable, 32 bit / 64 bit
	
		 Example Issues: 64-bit driver is not installed, run the package in 32-bit mode. 

		Solution: Project-->right click--> properties--> configuration settings--< debugging--> 64 But runtime: False 

		Example Issues: 32-bit driver is not installed, run the package in 64-bit mode. 

		Solution: Project-->right click--> properties--> configuration settings--< debugging--> 64 But runtime: True 

		c) If excel opened also, it will not allow you to operate.


c) OLEDB Source to OLEDB Destination load

d) Oledb Source to Raw Destination

e) XML file to target

f) RAW file to flat file loading

g) Working on fixed length files

h) Moving csv files to Target

=====================================================================================
Working on Flat FIle Source Properties [Refer to the PDF]
 =====================================================================================
a) Connection manager creation [you know about this]
b)Retain NULL values as NULLs [If we don't check this, system will treat NULL as Zero (numeric) or Space (String)
c) Preview: Sample Data
d) ErrorOutput Options

	When a field (column) has error or truncation, what you want to do?

	a)Fail component: Because of error / truncation failing it

	b) Ignore Failure: The error / truncation ignored

	c) Redirect Row: Redirecting the error / truncation [to another target]

	Examples:

	ID is numeric column, if you get a string value in the column, then it is error
	SAL(7,2) value, if you get (8,2) value, then it is truncation

e) Advanced Editor:

	After establishing connection manager, if you want to modify any settings, this is required

	Source-->right click-->Show Advanced Editor

f) IsFastParse: True

	This will do faster compilation

Scenario: From source load correct records to target and wrong data into another target [Material]



=====================================================================================
Working on OLDB Source Properties
 =====================================================================================
It has four options:

a)Table / view: If we know the table or view name [Static]

b)Table / view variable: If it is changing at run time [Dynamic table / view]

c)SQL Command: Takes SQL command 

                               [Select query tables/views, EXEC command of procedures …][Static]
	  
	Real time: 

	a) To get required rows and columns from single or multiple tables [Joins supported] 
	c)Calling a procedure to get data as input

d) SQL Command from variable: If the command changing at runtime [Dynamic]



=====================================================================================
Working on OLEDB Destination Properties
 =====================================================================================

It has five options:

a)Table / view: If we know the table or view name [Static]. Normal Load.

b)Table / view variable: If it is changing at run time [Dynamic table / view]

c)Table / view-Fastload: If we know the table or view name [Static]. Faster loading and has options during load also.

d)Table / view variable-Fastload: If it is changing at run time [Dynamic table / view]. Faster loading and has options during load also.

c)SQL Command: Takes SQL command to load data

                               

=====================================================================================
Faqs

	a)Server Configuration [CPU and Memory]
	b)Record Size
	c)Optional, but a load test run of the specified number of records
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do we load not loaded records into target table?

a)A Left join B  + where right hand side cols is null-------- Target [B]

b)A minus B - target [B]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a table having clustered index, what kind of load option is suitable?

FASTLOAD OPTION


For better loading of data into target what we need to ensure?

a)Ensure no or less indices available on the tables

b) Ensure no triggers and many constraints available on the table

c)If there is a clustered index which improves performance than non-clustered index.
